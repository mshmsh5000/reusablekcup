# The Reusable K-Cup
How to use it.

## Why are we doing this

Once you get the hang of it, it's better coffee than a prepackaged K-Cup. And you don't waste plastic.

## 1: Grind the coffee

So far, the best setting seems to be around 15, a little finer than what you'd use for a pourover. It's nice to grind more than you need, so other friends can save time.

## 2: Find the parts

They look like this. You need a filter and the cup (with cap).

## 3: Put all the things together

- Gently tamp down the coffee with your finger.
- Keep the grinds off of the edge of the filterâ€”makes it easier to put the cap on.
- Make sure the cap is totally snapped in.

## 4: Make your coffee

Just make it. I'd suggest picking the middle size on the machine.

## 5: Toss the coffee + filter

It looks like this when you throw it away:

## 6: IDK, smile or something
